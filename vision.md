Welcome to the **Broadening Participation in Data Mining** website.
Our primary aim is to foster mentorship, guidance, and connections of minority and
underrepresented groups in Data Mining, while also enriching technical aptitude
and exposure. We provide venues in which to encourage students from such groups
to connect with junior and senior researchers in industry, academia, and
government. We hope to create and help grow meaningful lasting connections
between researchers, thereby strengthening the Data Mining Community.

Since 2012, BPDM has grown into a series of yearly events.
See more on our [Events](events.md) section.
