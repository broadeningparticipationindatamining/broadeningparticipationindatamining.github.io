### 1. Who is eligible to apply for a scholarship?

Scholarship applications are open to students and postdocs, including:

- Undergraduate and Graduate students
- Part-time and Full-time
- U.S. Nationals and International students

Students or Postdocs eligible to apply for funding must satisfy one of the following criteria:

- Attend U.S. Institution and come from an underrepresented group in Data Mining

    - Women
    - Persons with disabilities
    - Minorities (i.e., African-American, Hispanic/Latino, or Native American/Alaska Native)

- Attend non-U.S. Institution and come from an underrepresented country which does not have an established Data Mining or Machine Learning degree program
 

### 2. What will applicant scholarships cover?

Applicant scholarships will cover flight, accommodations, food, and conference registration. However, due to budgetary constraints, applicants residing outside of the U.S. may have to supplement some of their flight cost from other funds.

  

### 3. When will applicants be notified?

For the up to date information, please visit the [event](event.md) page.

   

### 4. Can I attend BPDM if I don't receive a scholarship, don't want to apply, or can fund my own travel? If so, how?

   BPDM is open to all conference registrants, however, due to mentoring activities and space constraints, we request all non-scholarship attendees to first request attendance by emailing bpdmprogram@gmail.com with the following information:

1. Name
2. Title
3. Institution/organization
4. Research interests
5. Indicate whether you would consider yourself a mentee or mentor


### 5. What groups are considered “underrepresented”?

According to the U.S. National Science Foundation, underrepresented students in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) include women, minorities (i.e., African-American, Hispanic/Latino, and Native American/Alaska Native), and persons with disabilities. 

Due to the international nature of the field and of the program, we also consider students who attend non-U.S. Institution and come from a country which does not have an established Data Mining or Machine Learning degree program to be underrepresented.

 

### 6. What are the objectives and structure of BPDM?

The main objective of BPDM is to mentor, guide, and advance applicants from underrepresented groups to become successful researchers in Data Mining, by providing career mentoring advice and discipline-specific overviews of past accomplishments and future research directions in the field. Specifically, the program will primarily focus on helping young researchers at the graduate and post-graduate level become knowledgeable and connected in research and research paradigms of Data Mining. This program is the first of its kind in Data Mining aimed directly at fostering mentorship, guidance, and aptitude of underrepresented groups.

The structure of the program is geared to provide students with opportunities to learn, share, and connect.

1. Learn - students will attend various panels and featured talks which will address common issues and advancements in Data Mining.
2. Share and Connect - various networking breaks and sessions will allow students to connect with mentors and peers, share their research, and expand their personal network.

     In order to provide students with relevant and appropriate material, the organizers have targeted respected and leading members of the community who have mentoring experience and who also come from underrepresented groups.

      

### 7. Where can I find more information from previous years?

BPDM started in 2012, co-hosted with the SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM12). Previous years events can be found at our Events section.

       

### 8. Who funds BPDM?

We are lucky to have a number of partners, public and private, who kindly provide funding for BPDM. They are listed below:

- U.S. National Science Foundation
- Robert Bosch LLC
- Coalition to Diversify Computing
- Committee on the Status of Women in Computing Research


### 9. Who else attends BPDM besides students and postdocs?

A number of senior researchers, academics, directors, and managers kindly donate their time, experience, and expertise to help broaden the participation in Data Mining through our program. These individuals come from National Labs, Academia, Industry, and Government, and are often funded from their own budget.
